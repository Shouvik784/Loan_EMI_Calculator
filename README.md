Loan EMI Calculator Using Python

Loan EMI Calculator

Objective:
Develop a program to calculate the monthly instaliment (EMI) for a loan using the given formula.
Steps:
Implement the EMI formula: EMI=P . R .  (1+R)N(1+R)N-1EMI = \frac{P \cdot R \cdot (1+R)^N}{(1+R)^N-1} EMI =(1+R)N-1P . R .  (1+R)N, where: 
P: Principal amount
R: Interest rate per month.
N: Number of months (loan terure)
Create an interactive program that accepts user inputs for principal, interest rate, and loan tenure.

1) Calculate the EMI using the formula.
2) Display the calculated EMI in a clear and formatted output.
3) Test the program with different inputs to ensure accuracy and rellability
